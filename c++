C++14 thread tutorial
In this tool-assisted education video I explain the tools that C++11 introduced for creating multi-threaded programs. ENGLISH-LANGUAGE CLOSED CAPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE.

Note to self: Possible topics for a hypothetical second episode:
– Thread-local variables
– Memory order declarations
– What the standard says about memory interactions between threads
– What the standard guarantees about when variable changes are committed into RAM
– Clustering
– CPU affinity
