Truly smart people learn, observe, decide, and act. They gain knowledge and then use that knowledge to address the problems in front of them. If you really want to be smart, use your intelligence to cause action in the physical universe — don’t use it just to think great thoughts to yourself.
Stay at ease in various situations.
If you are not in/at ease, you are in disease.
If you keep the body at ease, then sleep does not occur to the body - unless it comes to a certain point of exhaustion.

Time and energy spent grieving over lost possessions keeps us from building our life back up again.
Messenger Rising's advice is a beacon for young men.
Peace is temporary just like everything else. Peace for me is a rest from turmoil. I choose peace over turmoil as often as I can, I fight when I have to but not without good reason. Angst and struggles take away precious time and energy. I've been tested many times, I know how I can be in the face of adversity but I would never purposely seek it out. I have nothing to prove. I have no doubt that life will beat me up again several times but I also know that I will see that suffering for what it is, temporary. If I become ill and suffer or die then that's just the way it is. People are born, they get ill, they die. I'm happy when life is peaceful but I know it's not a permanent disposition.

Increase and expand your income, and live below your means.

Happiness is learning to enjoy discipline over indulgence.
Suffer the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.
“We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.” ― Jim Rohn
Turning men toward Act 2 of the MGTOW path is important: building your personal wealth. I struck out as an entrepreneur nearly 15 years ago and my two cents would be that while of course you want to make money, the process of learning how the world actually works will pay big dividends when you enter middle age. Courage and youthful energy colliding with the harsh realities of what it takes to be successful cannot be taught, faked, or bought.

Let the youth who need an education set to work with a determination to obtain it. Do not wait for an opening; make one for yourselves. Take hold in any small way that presents itself. Practice economy. Do not spend your means for the gratification of appetite, or in pleasure seeking. Be determined to become as useful and efficient as God calls you to be. Be thorough and faithful in whatever you undertake. Procure every advantage within your reach for strengthening the intellect. Let the study of books be combined with useful manual labor, and by faithful endeavor, watchfulness, and prayer secure the wisdom that is from above. This will give you an all-round education. Thus you may rise in character, and gain an influence over other minds, enabling you to lead them in the path of uprightness and holiness.

Alongside reading 10 books/week, I also enjoy gulping audiobooks. I read somewhere that if you listen to audios at double the speed, the comprehension is greater. So using GarageBand, I've been changing the tempo of my audiobooks from 120 to 200. So I'd listen to 1 hour's worth of content in about 30 or 40 minutes.

“Do not wait: the time will never be ‘just right’. Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command and better tools will be found as you go along.”― Napoleon Hill

If you want to be an actual computer programmer, learn how to use the tools you have to use to accomplish goals. Theorycrafting never solved a single programming problem. Get your hands dirty. Learn the right way and wrong way to write code for yourself, the hard way, the only way, through real life experience.

“Don’t wait until everything is just right. It will never be perfect.
There will always be challenges, obstacles and less than perfect conditions.
So what. Get started now. With each step you take, you will grow stronger and stronger, more and more skilled, more and more self-confident and more and more successful.” — Mark Victor Hansen

Studies consistently show that when we look back on our lives the most common regrets are not the risks we took, but the ones we didn’t. Of the many regrets people describe, regrets of inaction outnumber those of action by nearly two to one. Some of the most common include not being more assertive, and failing to seize the moment. When people reflect later in life, it is the things they did not do that generate the greatest despair. You can seize the moment today!

The best work habit you can ever get into is very simple: Do your worst task first thing in the morning. Every given day, you've got one major to-do that's highest priority. But when you've got the whole day stretching out ahead of you, it's easy to put it off until after you get coffee, check email, or go to meeting. But just like breakfast is the most important meal of the day, the first thing you accomplish at work sets the tone for the rest of the day.

Put money where mouth is.

Getting the worst tasks out of the way first can clear your path for the rest of the day, so commit to at least starting those tasks as early as possible.

Repeat a personal mantra to yourself when you hit stress points. Make it something simple to remember that calms you and reminds you of the important things in life. This is a simple way to retrain your brain and tell it how to respond to stress. Instead of letting stressful points send you into a panicked mode, you pull out your mantra and tell your brain that it's going ot be okay. A few of my favorites: This too shall pass. I am stronger than I think. I can learn what I need to learn when I need to learn it. I've handled worse than this. I am not alone. There is freedom here. When I take responsibility, I take power.

Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward. How much you can take, and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now, if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hit, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you are because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that!

The past is just training. The past should definitely inform but in no way define you -- unless you let it.

Attitude makes all the difference.

Sour cream, or smetana in Russian, is one of the key ingredients in Russian cuisine.
Sour cream is very easy to make, although it's best to use unpasteurized milk or cream. Put four cups of full-fat milk or cream in a glass jar. Add a spoon of yogurt or some yogurt bacteria. Cover with a cheesecloth, and leave in a warm place overnight. The next morning, If you started with milk, you can skim the top layer off – and there's your sour cream. If you were using cream, the whole quantity will have turned into sour cream. It will keep in the refrigerator for two or three days. Boil some potatoes, put sour cream, salt and some fresh herbs on top and Priyatnogo appetita!

Tip for Making Easy-to-Peel Boiled Eggs:
Poke the flatter end of the egg with a small, sterilized pin. This, he says, make them easier to peel. The Science of Cooking site explains what might be at play here and a few other benefits you might get from the pin prick:
	Some people use a pin to make a small hole in the shell at the large end of the egg before they put the egg in the water. At the large end of each egg is a small air space. When you hard cook an egg, this air heats up, expands, and escapes through pores in the shell—but not before the egg white sets. This leaves the egg with a flattened end. Pricking the egg provides a quick escape route for the air, which gives you an egg with a smoothly rounded end. If you prick an egg, watch for a jet of air shooting from the hole as the egg cooks.
	Scientists disagree on the other possible benefits of pricking an egg. Some say that piercing the eggshell with a pin lets water leak between the shell and the egg's internal membrane, making for an egg that's easier to peel. Others claim that providing a quick way out for expanding gases makes the egg less likely to crack as it cooks, which may be particularly important for older eggs with larger air sacs. Still others say that poking a hole in the shell weakens it, making cracks more likely.

In 2018, Russia might legalize bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies in order to combat illegal transactions, said Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev in an interview with Bloomberg on April 10.
Two days later the Moscow business newspaper, Vedomosti, citing a Central Bank official, reported (in Russian) that the regulator and other ministries are developing a joint position on the status of cryptocurrencies, and will determine how to regulate them.
The Swiss government has already regulated the blockchain. "Recently, Switzerland passed legislation on the launch of the ICO (an equivalent of the IPO that allows companies to trade their shares in crypto stock exchanges). All companies that are introducing the ICO are doing it through Switzerland," said Gurieva.

Life is too short, write fast code.
Every programmer should understand what a register is, and how it is used. Some to the point of building a register out of simple electrical gates and clocking stuff into it.
Even languages like java, while not directly interfacing with cpu registers, are using a form or registers behind the scene.
More advanced users should be introduced to different types of registers. My favorite is the circular register. It fascinates me how it is efficient because of the way it maintains space due to the consideration of the common locality of functions and arguments.

OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an application programming interface (API) that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran,[3] on most platforms, instruction set architectures and operating systems, including Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, Linux, macOS, and Windows. It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence run-time behavior.

Language agnostic refers to aspects of programming that are independent of any specific programming language. The world "agnostic" is derived from the ancient Greek for "don't know".

Java:
Java 8 is knocking on the door. And with Java 8 come lambdas, whether you like them or not. Your API consumers may like them, though, and you better make sure that they can make use of them as often as possible. Hence, unless your API accepts simple “scalar” types such as int, long, String,Date, let your API accept SAMs as often as possible. What’s a SAM? A SAM is a Single Abstract Method [Type]. Also known as afunctional interface, soon to be annotated with the @FunctionalInterface annotation. This goes well with rule number 2, where EventListener is in fact a SAM.

шарын шашин
Тэмцдэггүй болгохын тулд л Монгол руу залсан Шарын Шашин...?
http://www.breakingnews.mn/c/r/51430

Улс үндэстний язгуур чанараа, тусгаар байдлаа өнө үүрд хадгалан үлдэхийн тулд бусдын шашиныг хүндэтгэн үзэх төдий бус өөрийн шашинтай байх ёстой юм байна гэдгийг хожуу ч гэсэн ойлгосон монголын дээдэс маань зөв хэрэглээ ахуйн нөхцлөөс үүдсэн тунгалаг оюуны бодлого ухаанаараа Буддын шашныг гэлэгва ёсны шарын шашны хэлбэрээр нь үндэсний шашнаа болгож авсны хүчинд өнөөдөр туурга тусгаар Монгол гэдэг улс оршин тогтнож байна.
Харамсалтай нь Ардын хувьсгал ялсны дараа Монголчуудад эд материалын хэрэглээг шүтэх метафизик сэтгэлгээний суурь бүхий өрнийн соёлыг нэвтрүүлэхийн тулд хүний сэтгэл оюуныг төгөлдөржүүлснээр хүн төрөлхтнийг гэгээрэлд түргэн хүргэх номлол сургаал бүхий Буддын шашны Их хөлгөний ёсыг эрхэмлэсэн Монголчуудын “ёс суртахууны өндөр соёл”-ыг бүх талаар даран устгах бодлого явагдсаныг энд давтан нурших нь илүүц биз ээ. Мэдээж шарын шашны ёс зүй, итгэл үнэмшлээр өрнийн соёлыг хүлээж авч чадахгүй нь ойлгомжтой бөгөөд бас өрнийн соёлыг нэвтрүүлж авахгүйгээр цаашид монгол улс оршин тогтнох боломжгүй байсан нь ч үнэн. Тийм л гачлант тохиол тулгарсан түүхийн тэрхүү “догшин давалгааг“ буруутган яллах, эсвэл дөвийлгөн үнэлэхийн аль аль нь буруу ухаарал, өрөөсгөл ойлголт болох билээ.
Үр дүнд нь шашин шүтлэгээс улбаалж бий болсон ёс суртахууны соёлоосоо Монголчууд ихээхэн хөндийрч олонхийн оюун ухаан нь ч ихээхэн мунхарч доройтсоны жишээг өнөөдөр бид бишгүй харж байна.

Түвдийн хэвийн боов, өлзий угалз хээ гэх мэт. Хадаг хүртэл Түвдийнх. Хадагнаас татгалзаж чадахгүй л байна даа. Цагаан сар ч бүр ард түмний баяр биш лам нарын баяр болсон доо. Лам нарын ч гэждээ Түвдийн шарын шашины баяр болсон. Зун даншиг гэж бас л лам нарын Түвдийн шарын шашины баяр болох жишээтэй.
Түвдүүд нэгэн цагт Монголчуудыг боолчилж явсан. Энэ боолчлол хамгийн харгис. Яагаад гэвэл хүнийг ямар ч идэвхигүй арчаагүй цаанаасаа зурсан зураг өгөгдсөн хувь заяа өөр ямар ч арга байхгүй энэ миний хувь тавилан гэж өөрөө өөртөө гомдон шаналан өрөвдөлт байдалд оруулдаг. Монгол хүн 100 жилийн өмнө ийм л байсан тэмбүү өвчиндөө баригдсан устана гэж хүртэл Өрнөдийн орнуудын жуулчид ам гарч байсан даа.

Түвдүүд нэгэн цагт Монголчуудыг боолчилж явсан. Энэ боолчлол хамгийн харгис. Яагаад гэвэл хүнийг ямар ч идэвхигүй арчаагүй цаанаасаа зурсан зураг өгөгдсөн хувь заяа өөр ямар ч арга байхгүй энэ миний хувь тавилан гэж өөрөө өөртөө гомдон шаналан өрөвдөлт байдалд оруулдаг. Монгол хүн 100 жилийн өмнө ийм л байсан тэмбүү өвчиндөө баригдсан устана гэж хүртэл Өрнөдийн орнуудын жуулчид ам гарч байсан даа.
Монголчууд энэ өдрүүдэд Далай ламд хэн болсоныгоо харуулна. Занабазараас хойш хөгжиж дэвшиж боловсролтой болж чадсан уу эсвэл мухар сүсэгтэй хэвээрээ арчаагүй оюуны доод түвшинд яг л 100 жилийн өмнөх шигээ хэвээрээ юу гэдгээ харуулна. Ямар ч гэсэн Хөдөө Аж Ахуйн Их Сургуулийнхан Түвдийн энэ ламд хүндэт доктор цол өгнө гэж 100 жилийн өмнөхөөсөө өөрчлөгдөөгүй гэдгээ харуулах гэж байх шиг.
Их сургуулийг анх байгуулсан дэлхийн ухаант хүмүүс шашинаас залуучуудыг тусгаарлаж мэдлэг боловсролтой болгох зорилготой байсан. Дэлхийн бүх их сургуулиуд шашинаас тусгаар тогтнож чадсан. Монголын Хөдөө Аж Ахуйн Их Сургуулийн профессорууд их сургуулийн нэр хүнд утга агуулгыг алдуулах инээдэмт эмгэнэлт жүжиг тоглохнээ. ШУТИС бол бүр хэдэн жилийн өмнө хүндэт доктор цол өгсөн байдаг. Тэр үеийн ректорууд 100 жилийн өмнөх хэвээрээ гэдгээ Далай ламд харуулж нотолсон.

Дашрамд зум гэдэг нь өд, үс ноосыг зумлаж зулгаахыг хэлэх бөгөөд, хятадын сүүлийн үед хийх болсон бүхлээр шарахтай ямар ч холбоогүй, тийм монгол хоол байхгүй болохыг ёс уламжлал судлаачид хэлж буй.

Битүү хуягласан энэ хүчирхэг тээврийн хэрэгсэл найдвартай гэдэг нь туршилтаар батлагдсан байна. ТАЙФУН хуягт тээвэрлэгч 6 кг ТНТ бодисын маш хүчтэй дэлбэрэлтийг давж чадсан ажээ. Өөрөөр хэлбэл ТАЙФУН-К газрын минанд өртсөн тохиолдолд дотор нь сууж яваа цэргүүд эсэн мэнд гарах юм.

"Харуул Занги" Цахим аюулгүй байдлын тэмцээн

Харуул занги ёс зүйт хакер, мөн үндэсний робокон 2013 тэмцээнүүдийг өнөөдөр үзлээ. Оюун ухаанаа ухсан эдгээр тэмцээнийг харахад гоё байлаа.

Буриадын элитүүдийн ухамсар, улс төрийн практикт энэ үеэс Өрнө Дорнын ертөнцийг үзэх үзэл холилдож эхэлсэн гэж болно. Тэд тодорхой үеэс эхлэн өөрсдийгөө төрөлх Азидаа Европын соёлыг түгээхэд манлайлагч, ЗХУ болон Хаант Оросын үзэл суртлын бодлогын зууч гэж үзэж эхэлсэн. Үүнээс болж,  буриадуудын дунд үндэсний шинжид харшилсан олон үндэстний өөрийншил (identity) тогтож эхэлсэн гэж би үздэг.

Товч нэр нь ВК гэх ВКонтакте буюу Холбоотой байя сайтын нэрийг Хяналттай байя гэж ёгтолчилсон хошин яриа ч тарах болжээ.

Сэтгэлийн хөдөлгөөнөөр асуудалд өнгөцхөн хандаж байгаа зүйл огт биш.

Нийгэмд болж байгааг нь биш, болохгүй байгааг нь хэлж, хашгирч байдаг хүмүүсийг активистууд идэвхтнүүд гэдэг юм билээ.

Европоосоо Америкт ажиллах нь надад илүү чөлөөтэй санагдаад. Эндээ онолын чиглэлээр ажиллаж байгаад 2006 оноос өөрийгөө дахиж сорих нэг алхам хийлээ. Энэ нь хэрэглээний лазерын чиглэлээр дахин PhD. хийхээр сэтгэл шулуудсан явдал. Ингэх олон шалтгаан байсан л даа. Тухайлбал, туршлагын физикээр нарийн мэргэшиж, онол-туршлагын "хос морь"-той болох. Нөгөө талаар Скалли бол квант оптикийг үндэслэгчдийн нэг төдийгүй Нобелийн шагналт Уиллис Лэмбийн шавь. Өрнөдөд өөрийн PhD дипломын удирдагчаа "доктор эцэг" гэж нэрлэдэг жишгээр би Лэмбийн "зээ шавь" болно гэсэн үг. Хэдийгээр би оюутан болох ч гэсэн оюутны биш, эрдэм шинжилгээний ажилтны зэрэглэлээр тасралтгүй үргэлжлүүлэн цалинжих олон жилийн баталгаа. Тэр үед хэрэгжүүлэхэд ярвигтай мөртлөө маш нэр хүндтэй төсөл эхэлж байсан бөгөөд яг гардаж хэрэгжүүлэх мэргэжлийн хүн хүрэлцээгүй байсан зэрэг нь шийдвэр гаргахад нөлөөлсөн. Гэхдээ хамгийн гол шалтгаан нь "Эрдэмд оройгүй!" гэсэн уламжлалт итгэл үнэмшил намайг зоригжуулж байсан. МУИС-ийн физикийн О.Лхагва багш маань бидэнд "-Номыг галзуу нохойны амнаас ч хамаагүй булаан авч сурдаг юм!" гэж сургаж байсан нь тэр үед санаанд орж байсан шүү.

Скалли бол олон ч нээлт хийсэн, нөлөөтэй том эрдэмтэн. Хүн эрдмийн ажил хийх нэг хэрэг. Гэтэл үүнийхээ хажуугаар менежмент сайн хийнэ гэдэг нь хүн болгонд байдаг авьяас биш. Скалли бол мундаг эрдэмтэн хэрнээ бас мундаг менежер хүн. Бараг 100 гаруй эрдэмтэд, PhD. оюутнууд түүний шууд удирдлага дор ажилладаг. Гэтэл надтай урьд нь уулзахдаа юу ярьж байсан, дараа уулзахдаа түүнийгээ л үргэлжлүүлээд ярьж чаддаг хүн. Гайхалтай чадвартай. Бид энэ төслийг Америкийн Батлан Хамгаалахын ахисан түвшиний Эрдэм шинжилгээний Агентлаг DARPA-аас авсан юм. Энэ бол зөвхөн квант физик төдийгүй биологитой холбоотой төсөл. Боомын халдвартай нянг аль болох хурдан хугацаанд танин мэдэх зорилготой. Энэ түүхийг ярилцлагын эхэнд дурдсан болно. Г.Г АНУ-д 9 сарын 11 ны террорист халдлагын дараа, биологийн халдлага болсон юм. Үүнээс болоод DARPA энэ төслийг хэрэгжүүлэхээр шийдсэн гэдэг.

Скаутын хөдөлгөөн үүссэн улс орон болгон Хүүхэд залуучуудын зуслан цугларалт буюу Жемборийг зохион байгуулдаг билээ. Энэхүү уламжлалын хүрээнд Монголын үндэсний тавдугаар Жемборийг "Сайн үйлсийн төлөө Нэгдэцгээе, Оролцоцгооё" уриатайгаар"  энэ оны долоодугаар сарын 2-8-ны хооронд Төв аймгийн Батсүмбэр сумын нутаг дахь Эко Скаут зусланд зохион байгуулах аж.

2001 онд Америкт биологийн алан хядах халдлага гарав. Шуудангаар илгээсэн боомын нянтай хэд хэдэн дугтуйг хүлээн авсан хүмүүс халдвар авсан байна. Ийм дугтуйг хүлээн авсан 22 хүнээс 5 нь нас баржээ. Квант физикийн нэрт эрдэмтэн судлаач, профессор Марлан Скаллигийн хүү нь онгоцны нисгэгч аж. Нэг удаагийн нислэгийн өмнөхөн онгоцноос нь дугтуйтай үл мэдэгдэх нунтаг олдсоноор зорчигчид нь айн сандралдав. Биологийн ээлжит халдлага байж магадгүй хэмээн айн болгоомжилсон хэрэг.

Харамсалтай нь уг нунтгийг боомын халдварт нян мөн эсэхийг шуурхай мэдэх ямар ч боломжгүй бөгөөд заавал лабораторид аваачиж шинжилгээ хийдэг ёстой. Энэ хэрээр ихээхэн цаг хугацаа алддаг аж.

There are many number systems. The base of the system determines the place value of each digit. The number system where place values are powers of 12 is called the duodecimal system. The digits used in this system are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T and E.

In a duodecimal place system, ten can be written as ᘔ, eleven can be written as Ɛ.
using "dek", "el" and "doh" as names for ten, eleven and twelve.

The ancient Babylonians used a number system with base 60 (sexagesimal).

In mathematics, two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities.
Mathematician Mark Barr proposed using the first letter in the name of Greek sculptor Phidias, phi, to symbolize the golden ratio. Usually, the lowercase form (φ) is used. Sometimes, the uppercase form (Φ) is used for the reciprocal of the golden ratio, 1/φ.

congruence
12 is congruent to 2 (modulo 5) since 12−2=2·5

convergence
An integral calculated over an interval of infinite width, called an improper integral, describes a region that is unbounded in at least one direction. If such an integral converges, the unbounded region it describes has finite area. A sequence of numbers converges to a particular number when the difference between successive terms becomes arbitrarily small. The sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc., converges to 1.

∞: lemniscate, a.k.a. infinity symbol.
a figure-eight shaped curve whose equation in polar coordinates is ρ2=a2 cos 2θ or ρ2=a2 sin 2θ.

Calculus classes, along with the accompanying physics-with-calculus classes, were what transformed my concept of math from a game you play with symbols into a powerful way to describe the way the world works.
There are definitely a lot of students who enjoy a calculus course for that experience. That seems to be a form of enjoyment that especially comes to students who have had time to learn about other topics on the way to learning calculus. Russian mathematical instruction tries harder than instruction in the United States to bring in examples from physical science at all ages, so that the mathematics that explains physics is taught to students who have a decent background in physics.

Coherent FMCW architecture

FMCW (frequency-modulated continuous wave) radar

In Doppler mode, the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) puts out a continuous tone at a fixed frequency.  The reflected signal is a frequency shifted version and speed can be determined.

Wireless transmission of energy can be achieved using several methods, such as  Inductive coupling, Electrodynamic induction and Resonant inductive coupling, far field electromagnetic radiation, laser and microwaves. 

Resonant inductive coupling is near field wireless transmission of electrical energy between two coils that are tuned to resonate at the same frequency. When properly designed, high efficiencies can be achieved.

Wireless power has a long history that includes the work of Ampere, Faraday, Hertz, Tesla, and other contributors in electromagnetic research.

Wireless technology to transmit power to mobile chargers is already on the market, and we can expect a grow in this technology i the near future.

Van de Graaff generator

So few people take high school or college physics classes, and so few of those who do attend have a long enough attention span to remember for more than a few days what they saw there...

Assuming that the power supply can deliver the current that's demanded, yes, current increases as voltage increases. Is it easier to get a damaging amount of current with a high voltage? Sure thing. Regardless, it's the current that causes damage.

Yes, if the belt were turned off, the charge would be, for all intents and purposes, static. If you wanted to increase the current, you would need to increase the number of charges per second being delivered to the dome. Increasing the speed of the motor would do this. So would widening the belt. Picking belt/pulley materials that are further apart on the triboelectric series would as well.

The ability to produce a spark is dependent on the voltage, not the current. In dry air, it's about 3,000,000 Volts per meter. The 'brightness' of the spark is what depends on the current.

Electrical conductivity of skin varies greatly, depending on a lot of factors. So, it can be quite high. It can also be surprisingly low. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that the presenter is a good enough conductor that his hair stands up and also immediately goes down once he touches the ground. If his body really did have infinite resistance, he wouldn't be able to collect a charge (his hair wouldn't stand up) and, if he had a charge, he would retain it upon touching the ground (his hair would remain standing upon touching the ground). Just by watching his hair, you can see that some current is flowing. The maximum steady state current that flows through him is limited by the physical construction of the Van de Graaff itself.

Volts never kill. It's just a measurement of the potential difference between two points.

Voltage plays a role in determining the current, but it's the current that flows through you and the current that kills you.

For the same reason why going to an all you can eat buffet doesn't mean that you have to eat -all- the food at the buffet. It's an upper limit. A 1000 A battery -can- supply 1000 A. It doesn't -have to- supply 1000 A. If the load demands 10 A, it gets 10 A. If it demands .01 A, it gets .01 A. If it demands 2000 A, then it's out of luck. Your body has a resistance on the order of 100,000 Ohms. That means it demands .00012 A from the 12 V battery, which is not anywhere close to being dangerous.

Even if you are perfectly insulated from the ground, there's still the problem of initially being at a different voltage than the power line. There will be a transient current as you are brought up to the line's voltage and that's easily enough to kill you.

Electric current is the number of charges passing a fixed point in second and voltage is a measurement of electric potential. To make an analogy with a waterfall, current is the amount of water going over the falls and voltage is the height of the falls. Amps is one unit used to measure current, just like meters is one unit used to measure distance.

Preemptive Incident Response (PIR)

"I took the view that, if convergence was the future and we could deliver it as free software, that would be widely appreciated both in the free software community and in the technology industry, where there is substantial frustration with the existing, closed, alternatives available to manufacturers. I was wrong on both counts. In the community, our efforts were seen fragmentation not innovation. And industry has not rallied to the possibility, instead taking a ‘better the devil you know’ approach to those form factors, or investing in home-grown platforms. What the Unity8 team has delivered so far is beautiful, usable and solid, but I respect that markets, and community, ultimately decide which products grow and which disappear".  - Mark Shuttleworth

Survivalism is a movement of individuals or groups (called survivalists or preppers) who are actively preparing for emergencies, including possible disruptions in social or political order, on scales from local to international. Survivalists often acquire emergency medical and self-defense training, stockpile food and water, prepare to become self-sufficient, and build structures (e.g., a survival retreat or an underground shelter) that may help them survive a catastrophe.

Tare weight /ˈtɛər/, sometimes called unladen weight, is the weight of an empty vehicle or container. By subtracting it from the gross weight (laden weight), the weight of the goods carried (the net weight) may be determined. This can be useful in computing the cost of the goods carried for purposes of taxation (sometimes called a tariff) or for tolls related to barge, rail, road, or other traffic, especially where the toll will vary with the value of the goods carried (e.g., tolls on the Erie Canal). Tare weight is often published upon the sides of railway cars and transport vehicles to facilitate the computation of the load carried. Tare weight is also used in body composition assessment when doing underwater weighing.
The word tare originates from the Middle French word tare "wastage in goods, deficiency, imperfection" (15c.), from Italian tara, from Arabic طرح ṭarḥ, lit. "thing deducted or rejected," from taraha "to reject".
Tare weight is accounted for in kitchen, analytical (scientific) weighing scales and other scales which include a button that resets the zero of the scale display when an empty container is placed on the weighing platform, in order to subsequently display only the weight of the contents of the container.
Gross weight (the total weight) = net weight (the weight of the goods) + tare weight (the weight of the empty container).

HR people know other HR people won't do it. But also because most employers will not divulge even a former employee's salary. Why would they? However, it's worth noting that HR circles in some areas and industries are tight -- there's a lot of back-channel communication. One HR person might tell another in another company about you -- and you'd never know. Why do I point this out? To remind people NEVER to make assumptions.
I referred a guy I know to a recruiting firm. He wound up getting a job offer but then he decided that he needed more money than they were potentially offering so he lied about his current salary. He got a call from the potential new employer pulling his offer b/c they contacted his current employer to verify his salary info. Apparently he lied by A LOT. This guy had the nerve to complain to me about how his offer was rescinded. With the straighest face ever, I replied "You're blaming ME for you getting caught in a lie? I'm glad they didn't hire you then".
low-ball:I know plenty of people that lied about their salary, and none of them got caught. The fact of the matter is, most big companies base their salary offer on your previous salary - offering 12-15% bumps generally. I'd say lying is worth the risk if you are severely underpaid, because every company you interview for is going to low-ball you if they know your real salary.

IOU (abbreviated from the phrase "I owe you") is usually an informal document acknowledging debt. An IOU differs from a promissory note in that an IOU is not a negotiable instrument and does not specify repayment terms such as the time of repayment. IOUs usually specify the debtor, the amount owed, and sometimes the creditor. IOUs may be signed or carry distinguishing marks or designs to ensure authenticity. In some cases, IOUs may be redeemable for a specific product or service rather than a quantity of currency, constituting a form of scrip.

Peeling ginger with a spoon: Using the edge of the spoon with the convex of the bowl facing towards you, scrape away the ginger's papery skin using firm, downward strokes. You can anchor the root on a cutting board or hold it in your other hand, either will work. Scrape away as much as needed from the larger root (the rest of the root will give you a nice 'handle' to steady the process) or the whole piece if that's what's needed. The spoon will make it easier to work your way over and around all the little nubs. With a spoon, pretty much just the skin will be removed.

Mind over Matter: Secrets of human aura revealed by Russian scientists:
A Russian scientist is trying to convince people they can change the world simply by using their own energy. He claims that thinking in a certain way can have a positive or negative effect on the surrounding environment. "We are developing the idea that our consciousness is part of the material world and that with our consciousness we can directly influence our world," said Dr. Konstantin Korotkov, a professor of physics at St. Petersburg State Technical University. To bridge our understanding of the unseen world of energy, scientific experiments are being carried out using a technique called bioelectrophotography. The assumption is that we are constantly emitting energy. Bioelectrophotography aims to capture these energy fields seen as a light around the body -- or what some people would call your aura.

WCC: world chess championship

Adjourn:
Carlsen's often opaque playing style, with its emphasis on endgames and physical toughness so as to exploit mistakes after a long and tiring session, is one reason he has detractors. It reflects the change from four-hour sessions followed by an overnight adjournment to six or seven hours without a break and with speeded up play for the later moves.

Magnus Carlsen has a grasp on the game 'that would usually take players 20 to 30 years'.

Magnus Carlsen, the new world chess champion, makes it sound so simple. But the possibilities in chess are almost infinite, and quite how he routinely - and apparently so effortlessly - identifies the best moves, fills the chess world with awe.

There is talk of him storming through the 2900 Elo rating barrier: in chess that would be a psychological breakthrough roughly equivalent to when Roger Bannister broke the 4-minute mile.

Carlsen is the complete chess player. He is brilliant at strategy as well as tactics: he has mastery of the opening, the middle game, the endgame. 

His memory is prodigious, almost photographic. He is said to hold 10,000 games in his head. He can play 10 games blindfold (without looking at the boards).

He's also physically fit - an essential ingredient to his success. Concentrating for hours at the board is - non-chess players may be surprised to hear - physically draining.

Carlsen enjoys long games, grinding out victory after victory as he slowly, inevitably, wears down his opponents.

That discipline and competitiveness is another vital component in his emotional make-up.

American world champion Bobby Fischer said he enjoyed the moment when he could sense the ego of his opponent crumble.

And, clearly, Carlsen also relishes the psychological warfare. 

Magnus Carlsen is Mozart in the world of chess. He played with 10 opponents at the same time, not looking at the chess boards and won. He kept tracking 320 chess pieces simultaneously. It seems out of this world to play with ten guy and win just with the power of thought.

Numerous experiments over the past few years have shown that the best way to build new neural pathways is to try and recall it afresh, helping subjects remember more than twice as much, over the long term, than just passively reading the material; self-testing also turns out to be more effective than creative techniques like drawing diagrams and mind maps.

Although you can find other apps designed for rote learning and drilling in this way, Memrise makes use of another trick. Detre had found that the most effective time to reactivate a memory is when you feel that it is half-remembered, half-forgotten – when you feel it’s on the “tip of your tongue” but you can't quite reach it. So the Memrise team have designed an algorithm that predicts the arrival of that agonising state, and then springs a test on you. Since the app constantly tracks your progress, over time it becomes more accurate at predicting your learning curve, helping you surf the waves of your memory to more efficient learning.

There's a lot of truth in your post, most “prodigies” of any field DO work hard to get where they are.

However, we are talking specifics. Specific subject, sport, ability.

I see true genius, prodigy, and intelligence not in what one can master… but in how quickly.

Your post is uplifting and gives hope for us “non-prodigy” people. However, there’s no going around the fact that, for example, my good friend can memorise 50+ foreign words in the time it takes me to memorise 10. Or read three books in the time I read one, and with better recollection than mine (on ANY subject we ever had together).

It is true, anyone can master a specific ground with perseverance. However, the sheer speed is what separates “anyone” from genius. And while we are still determined to do “A” the genius is already on “E, F, G” … that to me is the disheartening part.

"I comprehended it, but it still didn't sink in that it was me, that a mother could just lay her baby down and walk away. That is just mind-blowing to me," Deprill said.

моржи - the Russian ice-swimmer.
People who enjoy swimming in icy water are called 'моржи'(walruses) in russia.

Members of the world's bravest swimming club took the plunge into a frozen lake - some wearing nothing more than a bikini.

The foolhardy swimmers braved outdoor temperatures of -10 degrees, jumping into a lake in Murmansk, Russia, in an icy ritual thought to have health benefits.

Alexandr Kryazshev, 26, snapped these amazing photos of the Walrus Swimming Club jumping into the Semenovskoe lake.

Club members called morzhi, Russian for "walruses", think swimming in icy waters can help with joint pain relief, stress relief and increased immunity.

Квас — традиционный славянский кислый напиток, который готовят на основе брожения из муки и солода (пшеничного, ячменного) или из сухого ржаного хлеба, иногда с добавлением пахучих трав, мёда, вощины; также приготовляется из свёклы, фруктов, ягод. Раньше он нередко служил основой холодных похлёбок. Лужиц. kwas «праздник, свадебный пир», ст.-словацк. kvas «пир, угощение, гуляние» свидетельствуют о том, что квас был основным хмельным напитком на праздниках и свадьбах.

Магнуса Карлсена называют Моцартом в мире шахмат. Он играл с 10 оппонентами одновременно, не смотря на игровые доски, и обыграл их всех в своей голове. Для этого нужно было постоянно помнить расположение 320 игровых фигурок.

Magnus Carlsen is Mozart in the world of chess. He played with 10 opponents at the same time, not looking at the chess boards and won. He kept tracking 320 chess pieces simultaneously. It seems out of this world to play with ten guy and win just with the power of thought.

(см.):
Сегодня мы знаем, что молекула ДНК является носителем кода, который управляет химизмом всего живого (см. Центральная догма молекулярной биологии), а двойная спираль молекулы ДНК стала одним из самых известных научных символов. Открытие ДНК, как и практически все великие открытия, не было результатом работы одинокого гения, а увенчало собой длинную цепь экспериментальных работ.
Такой «возможный механизм копирования» определен структурой ДНК. Когда клетка приступает к делению и необходима дополнительная ДНК для дочерних клеток, ферменты (см. Катализаторы и ферменты) начинают «расстегивать» лестницу ДНК, как застежку-«молнию», обнажая индивидуальные основания. Другие ферменты присоединяют соответствующие основания, находящиеся в окружающей жидкой среде, к парным «обнажившимся» основаниям — А к Т, Г к Ц и т. д. В результате на каждой из двух разошедшихся цепей ДНК достраивается соответствующая ей цепь из компонентов окружающей среды, и исходная молекула дает начало двум двойным спиралям.

During the height of the Cold War the Soviet Union built up a network of "Naukograd" or "Science Cities". These were state-created clusters of scientists working on technologies that could help it compete with the West, especially in the field of nuclear weapons and space exploration. Those days are of course long gone, but today Russia -- though now freed from the days of the old USSR -- now faces a new race: how to revive its economy, compete globally in the next industrial revolution of science and technology and wean itself off its reliance on oil and gas.

The Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) is a private graduate research university in Skolkovo, Russia, a suburb of Moscow. Established in October 2011 in collaboration with MIT, Skoltech educates global leaders in innovation, advances scientific knowledge and fosters new technologies to address critical issues facing Russian and the world. Applying international research and educational models, the university integrates the best Russian scientific traditions with twenty-first century entrepreneurship and innovation.

liability
Hit on the Head – How to determine if your woman is a liability.
In fact, getting married to modern women is like getting a degree. You think you are being sold an asset, but what you are getting is a liability.

The safest way to invest is to choose a few good mutual or index funds with a proven track record and then stick with them even as the market goes up and down.
This allows you to recover from the low points in the market, and it protects you from a business going under and you losing all the money you have invested. When you look at a mutual fund you want to choose one that has been open for several years, and has a history of earning a profit more than losing money.

badge-in/badge-out: In some parts of the organization, especially on the Financial Products sales side, there is still too much clock-watching on the part of managers and less leading by accomplishments and overall productivity. However, in Engineering, they have really tried to minimize the "badge-in/badge-out" culture and are much more flexible about arrival times, departure times and working from home.
Crippling bureaucracy, management by fear and intimidation, a cover-your-ass mentality (which leads to busy work assigned "just in case"), mercurial leaders who won't accept questions or dissent and shifting goal posts for what constitutes success.
turnover rate: Should pay more attention to developers and their thoughts. The high turnover rate is for a reason.
Turnover rate is the percentage of employees in a workforce that leave during a certain period of time. Organizations and industries as a whole measure their turnover rate during a fiscal or calendar year.

Let’s not forget: pour over brewing requires incremental pouring - some recipes even require you to meticulously regulate each pour by weight - and a gooseneck kettle makes it much easier to avoid the pain of under-pouring or over-pouring each round.
Essentially, this type of kettle is for the barista what a fine-tipped brush is for the painter: a perfectionist’s tool.

The most basic element in bc is the number. Numbers are arbitrary precision numbers. This precision is both in the integer part and the fractional part. All numbers are represented internally in decimal and all computation is done in decimal. (This version truncates results from divide and multiply operations.) There are two attributes of numbers, the length and the scale. The length is the total number of significant decimal digits in a number and the scale is the total number of decimal digits after the decimal point. For example:
.000001 has a length of 6 and scale of 6.
1935.000 has a length of 7 and a scale of 3.

Notice period is the time period between the receipt of the letter of dismissal and the end of the last working day. This time period has to be given to an employee by his employer before his employment ends.
There are two types of notice period: statutory and contractual. Statutory notice is the minimum legal notice that can be given. Employers should give the employee:
  one week's notice if the employee has been employed by the employer continuously for one month or more, but for less than two years
  two weeks' notice if the employee has been employed by the employer continuously for two years, and one additional week's notice for each further complete year of continuous employment, up to a maximum of 12 weeks. For example if an employee has worked for 5 years then they are entitled to 5 weeks' notice.

comprehend vs apprehend
"Apprehend" means to take into custody or grasp mentally. While "apprehend" sometimes means "understand," it is best to use "comprehend" because it's easier for most people to understand. The noun form, "apprehension," means a foreboding or dread of something. Example: Please apprehend the criminal. "Comprehend" means to grasp mentally or understand fully. Example: Do you comprehend this material? The adjective "comprehensive" means all-inclusive or having a wide range.

delayed/deferred gratification
Delayed gratification, or deferred gratification, is the ability to resist the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence. It is theorized that the ability to delay rewards is under the control of the cognitive-affective personality system (CAPS).

Researchers followed each child for more than 40 years and over and over again, the group who waited patiently for the second marshmallow succeed in whatever capacity they were measuring. In other words, this series of experiments proved that the ability to delay gratification was critical for success in life.

temporal lobe
The cerebral cortex can be divided into four sections, which are known as lobes (see image above). The frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe have been associated with different functions ranging from reasoning to auditory perception.
Auditory perception refers to the ability of the brain to interpret and create a clear impression of sounds. Good auditory skills enable children to distinguish between different pitches, volumes, rhythms and sources of sounds and words, which has amongst others, significant benefits for learning reading.

Declining Virility of Men and the Importance of Testosterone
Testosterone is the fuel that will power you along the road to manhood. It’s what makes men strong, daring, and aggressive.
Free Testosterone. This is testosterone in its purest form. It’s the crack of testosterone, if you will. The reason it’s called “free” is because there aren’t any proteins attached to it. Unbound to other molecules, free T can enter cells and activate receptors in order to work its virile magic on your body and mind.

A man's claim to virtue is weak if he doesn’t have the virile fortitude and strength to back it up when challenged. The cloak of virtue hangs very awkwardly on a man without fire and fight; it droops and sags when draped across a structure that lacks strength and firmness. We all know amiable men who are sickly thin or grossly overweight, who look like they’d burst into tears if a bully broke their walking stick and would get winded mounting a flight of stairs.

Foster a DIY mentality

You don't have time to do all of the homework, and kind of repeat them, but pick some of the key ones and see if you can do it again. Like practice it, and maybe do it in your mind. Can you step through all the steps? If you can play it almost like a song in your mind, you've really got it. You've got it down as a chunk, and that can help build your knowledge of the material. Now, probably the most valuable technique when you're trying to really understand something difficult is simple recall.

Read in sentences at once(at a time), resist the urge to reread or underline, instead, look away and recall the text, that's very powerful in building your understanding of the material in a way that other techniques, including mind mapping and re-reading are not nearly as good as recall.

A Rube Goldberg machine is a contraption, invention, device or apparatus that is deliberately over-engineered or overdone to perform a very simple task in a very complicated fashion, usually including a chain reaction.

The cooking method that best retains nutrients is one that cooks quickly, heats food for the shortest amount of time, and uses as little liquid as possible. Microwaving meets those criteria. Using the microwave with a small amount of water essentially steams food from the inside out. That keeps more vitamins and minerals than almost any other cooking method.

Using too much water can leach vitamins and minerals out of food.
The rumor: Zapping food in a microwave leaches out key nutrients.
The verdict: If you do it right, cooking food in the microwave is one of the best ways to retain your food's vitamins and minerals.

Internal Revenue Service
The IRS requires employers to report wage and salary information for employees on Form W-2. Your W-2 also reports the amount of federal, state and other taxes withheld from your paycheck. As an employee, the information on your W-2 is extremely important when preparing your tax return. To insure you have it in time, the IRS requires your employer to send you a W-2 no later than January 31 following the close of the tax year, which is usually December 31.

Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement
Every employer engaged in a trade or business who pays remuneration, including noncash payments of $600 or more for the year (all amounts if any income, social security, or Medicare tax was withheld) for services performed by an employee must file a Form W-2 for each employee (even if the employee is related to the employer) from whom:
Income, social security, or Medicare tax was withheld.
Income tax would have been withheld if the employee had claimed no more than one withholding allowance or had not claimed exemption from withholding on Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate.

Mandatory arbitration. Be careful – employers slip these in.  They waive your right to a jury in the event that you have a future dispute with your employer and lock you into a private, truncated dispute resolution process. While arbitration tends to be quicker and less expensive than court litigation, it also can prevent you from collecting and presenting as much evidence as you could in court, and there is no right to appeal, just limited grounds to contest an arbitration ruling against you.

I have heard stories of white flour immediately causing abscess when consumed.

abscess: A swollen area within body tissue, containing an accumulation of pus:
e.g. ’Once the abscesses burst, they usually discharge for several days before gradually healing up.’
Around 40% of brain abscesses are caused by infections spread from areas nearby in the body, in the nose, throat and ear areas.
 ‘At least 75% of cerebral abscesses are associated with infections elsewhere in the body.’
Brain abscesses are a medical emergency because they can raise the pressure on the brain to a point that may be fatal.
‘Your GP will normally prescribe oral antibiotics to fight the infection before an abscess has a chance to develop.’
figurative ‘one of his priorities as prime minister was to lance the abscess of corruption.’

Gingivitis, a very common condition that causes the gums to redden, swell, and bleed, is typically caused by the gradual buildup of plaque.

Ultralearning projects are hard work. Not only do they require you to take time out of your life, but they’re also mentally demanding. Given this, a good question to ask might be, why bother ultralearning at all?
The opposite of ultralearning is dabbling. This means playing around with something and eventually learning it. There’s no commitment. No time put aside. And if it becomes too mentally difficult or boring, you stop.

three-prong plug
Why do electrical plugs have a hole in each prong?
(Within the outlet, there are 2 plates with dull indentations that press into the holes and help hold in the cord, so it doesn't fall out as easily. 
Also, some special outlets allow you to lock the cord into the socket, so it can't be removed, by putting rods through the holes.
If you were to take apart an outlet and look at the contact wipers that the prongs slide into, you would find that they have have bumps on them. These bumps fit into the holes so that the outlet can grip the plug's prongs more firmly. This detenting prevents the plug from slipping out of the socket due to the weight of the plug and cord. It also improves the contact between the plug and the outlet.
Electrical devices can be "factory-sealed" or "locked-out" by the manufacturer or owner using a plastic tie or a small padlock that runs through one or both of the prong holes. Construction projects or industrial safety requirements may require this type of sealing. For example, a manufacturer might apply a plastic band through the hole and attach it to a tag that says, "You must do blah blah blah before plugging in this device." The user cannot plug in the device without removing the tag, so the user is sure to see the instructions.)

My videos are not only meant to help induce ASMR or tingles, but also help provide a relaxing, calming and soothing experience for the viewer while helping to provide stress relief (especially for those suffering from depression, anxiety and even PTSD), help people sleep and even serve as a study aid.

Hajime Narukawa used a new map (main) making method called AuthaGraph that divides the globe into 96 triangles, transfers them a tetrahedron and unfold it to be a rectangle - all while keeping the landmasses and seas proportioned. The map was made by equally dividing a spherical surface into 96 triangles, transferring it to a tetrahedron and unfolding it to be a rectangle- all while keeping the landmasses and seas proportioned.

Sprain is a stretch or tear in a ligament. Ligaments are bands of fibrous tissue that connect bones to bones at joints. Strain is also a stretch or tear, but it happens in a muscle or a tendon.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a blood test marker for inflammation in the body. CRP is produced in the liver and its level is measured by testing the blood. CRP is classified as an acute phase reactant, which means that its levels will rise in response to inflammation.

Chess Guidelines (Principles)
If you don't know what to do, identify your worst piece and find a way to make it better.
"If you can't find a plan, find your worst piece and make it better." Alternatively, "...find your opponent's worst piece and keep it bad." Often a great plan is just to make your worst piece better.

Always castle with one hand -- move the king first, then complete castling by moving the rook. This avoids confusion as to what piece you intended to move. (Castling is considered a king move.)

Besides not conforming to the definition of “simultaneous”, why is this difference important and why does it make exhibitor’s task easier than starting all games at the same time? All previous blindfold champions have stated that the first 10-15 moves of a game are the hardest to handle. Of course the games all start in the same position and the exhibitor needs to make individual games distinctive as soon as possible to avoid confusion among them (see the discussion of how champions plan their sequence of openings in advance to alleviate or prevent this confusion problem on pages 193-196 of our book). With successive “waves"of players an exhibitor could make the current games reasonably distinctive before the next wave began.

Chess960 (also known as Fischer Random Chess or Fischerandom)
White pawns are placed on the second rank as in standard chess. All remaining white pieces are placed randomly on the first rank, with two restrictions:
The bishops must be placed on opposite-color squares.
The king must be placed on a square between the rooks.
Black's pieces are placed equal-and-opposite to White's pieces. For example, if the white king is randomly determined to start on f1, then the black king is placed on f8. (The king never starts on the a - or h -file, since this would leave no space for a rook.)
Each bishop can take one of four positions; for each position of two bishops, the queen can be placed on six different squares; and then the two knights can assume five or four possible positions, respectively. This leaves three open squares which the king and rooks must occupy per setup stipulations, without choice. This means there are 4×4×6×5×4 = 1920 possible starting positions if the two knights were different in some way. The two knights are indistinguishable during play (if swapped, there would be no difference), however, so the number of distinguishable possible positions is half of 1920, or 1920÷2 = 960. (Half of the 960 positions are left–right mirror images of the other half; however, Chess960 castling rules preserve left–right asymmetry in play.)

「自分には才能がないから天職なんか見つけられない」とネガティブに考える人もいるかもしれないが，これも間違いである。最も注目すべき点は，その鍵となるのは「天から授かった才能や適正」なんかではなくて，「その職についていて楽しくて楽しくてしょうがないこと」だという点だ。

マラソンのランナーは，毎日のように20キロも30キロも走る。私にとっては，たとえ5キロのランニングでも，精神的にも肉体的にも信じがたいような苦痛だが，彼らにとってはそれは本当の意味での「苦痛」ではないのだ。確かに，肉体的には過酷なことをしているし，精神的にも肉体的にも常に自分自身をレースに備えた状態に保つのは簡単な話ではない。しかし，マラソンを走り続ける人たちに共通して言えることは，彼ら自身が，そんな努力を自ら喜んでやっている点だ。

chess:"opening" is for white and "defense" is for black?
xyz(placeholder) opening is speaking of white's play and zyx(placeholder) defense is referring to black's play, is that correct?
or
opening schemes are played by white, while defense schemes are played by opponent -- the black.
Is this thinking correct?

#utv comment
I think that a lot of the intellectual indolence spoken of here can be indirectly attributed to the optimism bias, which supposedly 80% of people are subject to. As a result of this cognitive error, it's all too easy to blithely assume that things will work out 'just fine' without putting any thought into the matter at hand. The consequences of this mode of thinking can range from trivial to disastrous, and it's something to be wary of in all manner of personal interactions.
