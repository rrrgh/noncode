Alongside reading 10 books/week, I also enjoy gulping audiobooks. I read somewhere that if you listen to audios at double the speed, the comprehension is greater. So using GarageBand, I've been changing the tempo of my audiobooks from 120 to 200. So I'd listen to 1 hour's worth of content in about 30 or 40 minutes.

The best work habit you can ever get into is very simple: Do your worst task first thing in the morning. Every given day, you've got one major to-do that's highest priority. But when you've got the whole day stretching out ahead of you, it's easy to put it off until after you get coffee, check email, or go to meeting. But just like breakfast is the most important meal of the day, the first thing you accomplish at work sets the tone for the rest of the day.

Put money where mouth is.

learning: 50% = reading, thinking, reasoning, deduction, imagination, organic combinatory thinking, listening, intuition, awareness, consciousness, etc. ; 50% = making, hacking, hands-on experiments. Practice makes perfect.

Getting the worst tasks out of the way first can clear your path for the rest of the day, so commit to at least starting those tasks as early as possible.

Repeat a personal mantra to yourself when you hit stress points. Make it something simple to remember that calms you and reminds you of the important things in life. This is a simple way to retrain your brain and tell it how to respond to stress. Instead of letting stressful points send you into a panicked mode, you pull out your mantra and tell your brain that it's going ot be okay. A few of my favorites: This too shall pass. I am stronger than I think. I can learn what I need to learn when I need to learn it. I've handled worse than this. I am not alone. There is freedom here. When I take responsibility, I take power.

Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward. How much you can take, and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now, if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hit, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you are because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that!

The past is just training. The past should definitely inform but in no way define you -- unless you let it.

Attitude makes all the difference.

There will never be a right time. There is never a good time to get married, quit your job, buy a house, or start a company. Everyone is given the same amount of time in a day, but the manner in which you choose to spend this time is entirely up to you. Now is as good a time as any.

Sour cream, or smetana in Russian, is one of the key ingredients in Russian cuisine.
Sour cream is very easy to make, although it's best to use unpasteurized milk or cream. Put four cups of full-fat milk or cream in a glass jar. Add a spoon of yogurt or some yogurt bacteria. Cover with a cheesecloth, and leave in a warm place overnight. The next morning, If you started with milk, you can skim the top layer off – and there's your sour cream. If you were using cream, the whole quantity will have turned into sour cream. It will keep in the refrigerator for two or three days. Boil some potatoes, put sour cream, salt and some fresh herbs on top and Priyatnogo appetita!

Tip for Making Easy-to-Peel Boiled Eggs:
Poke the flatter end of the egg with a small, sterilized pin. This, he says, make them easier to peel. The Science of Cooking site explains what might be at play here and a few other benefits you might get from the pin prick:
	Some people use a pin to make a small hole in the shell at the large end of the egg before they put the egg in the water. At the large end of each egg is a small air space. When you hard cook an egg, this air heats up, expands, and escapes through pores in the shell—but not before the egg white sets. This leaves the egg with a flattened end. Pricking the egg provides a quick escape route for the air, which gives you an egg with a smoothly rounded end. If you prick an egg, watch for a jet of air shooting from the hole as the egg cooks.
	Scientists disagree on the other possible benefits of pricking an egg. Some say that piercing the eggshell with a pin lets water leak between the shell and the egg's internal membrane, making for an egg that's easier to peel. Others claim that providing a quick way out for expanding gases makes the egg less likely to crack as it cooks, which may be particularly important for older eggs with larger air sacs. Still others say that poking a hole in the shell weakens it, making cracks more likely.

Chess Guidelines (Principles)
If you don't know what to do, identify your worst piece and find a way to make it better.
"If you can't find a plan, find your worst piece and make it better." Alternatively, "...find your opponent's worst piece and keep it bad." Often a great plan is just to make your worst piece better.

Default installations of Ubuntu must have no listening network services after initial install. Exceptions to this rule include network infrastructure services such as the DHCP client and mDNS (Avahi/ZeroConf, see ZeroConfPolicySpec for implementation details and justification).

Java:
Java 8 is knocking on the door. And with Java 8 come lambdas, whether you like them or not. Your API consumers may like them, though, and you better make sure that they can make use of them as often as possible. Hence, unless your API accepts simple “scalar” types such as int, long, String,Date, let your API accept SAMs as often as possible. What’s a SAM? A SAM is a Single Abstract Method [Type]. Also known as afunctional interface, soon to be annotated with the @FunctionalInterface annotation. This goes well with rule number 2, where EventListener is in fact a SAM. The best SAMs are those with single arguments, as they will further simplify writing of a lambda.

Харуул Занги
"Харуул Занги" Цахим аюулгүй байдлын тэмцээн

Харуул занги ёс зүйт хакер, мөн үндэсний робокон 2013 тэмцээнүүдийг өнөөдөр үзлээ. Оюун ухаанаа ухсан эдгээр тэмцээнийг харахад гоё байлаа.

Буриадын элитүүдийн ухамсар, улс төрийн практикт энэ үеэс Өрнө Дорнын ертөнцийг үзэх үзэл холилдож эхэлсэн гэж болно. Тэд тодорхой үеэс эхлэн өөрсдийгөө төрөлх Азидаа Европын соёлыг түгээхэд манлайлагч, ЗХУ болон Хаант Оросын үзэл суртлын бодлогын зууч гэж үзэж эхэлсэн. Үүнээс болж,  буриадуудын дунд үндэсний шинжид харшилсан олон үндэстний өөрийншил (identity) тогтож эхэлсэн гэж би үздэг.

Товч нэр нь ВК гэх ВКонтакте буюу Холбоотой байя сайтын нэрийг Хяналттай байя гэж ёгтолчилсон хошин яриа ч тарах болжээ.

Сэтгэлийн хөдөлгөөнөөр асуудалд өнгөцхөн хандаж байгаа зүйл огт биш.

Нийгэмд болж байгааг нь биш, болохгүй байгааг нь хэлж, хашгирч байдаг хүмүүсийг активистууд идэвхтнүүд гэдэг юм билээ.

Европоосоо Америкт ажиллах нь надад илүү чөлөөтэй санагдаад. Эндээ онолын чиглэлээр ажиллаж байгаад 2006 оноос өөрийгөө дахиж сорих нэг алхам хийлээ. Энэ нь хэрэглээний лазерын чиглэлээр дахин PhD. хийхээр сэтгэл шулуудсан явдал. Ингэх олон шалтгаан байсан л даа. Тухайлбал, туршлагын физикээр нарийн мэргэшиж, онол-туршлагын "хос морь"-той болох. Нөгөө талаар Скалли бол квант оптикийг үндэслэгчдийн нэг төдийгүй Нобелийн шагналт Уиллис Лэмбийн шавь. Өрнөдөд өөрийн PhD дипломын удирдагчаа "доктор эцэг" гэж нэрлэдэг жишгээр би Лэмбийн "зээ шавь" болно гэсэн үг. Хэдийгээр би оюутан болох ч гэсэн оюутны биш, эрдэм шинжилгээний ажилтны зэрэглэлээр тасралтгүй үргэлжлүүлэн цалинжих олон жилийн баталгаа. Тэр үед хэрэгжүүлэхэд ярвигтай мөртлөө маш нэр хүндтэй төсөл эхэлж байсан бөгөөд яг гардаж хэрэгжүүлэх мэргэжлийн хүн хүрэлцээгүй байсан зэрэг нь шийдвэр гаргахад нөлөөлсөн. Гэхдээ хамгийн гол шалтгаан нь "Эрдэмд оройгүй!" гэсэн уламжлалт итгэл үнэмшил намайг зоригжуулж байсан. МУИС-ийн физикийн О.Лхагва багш маань бидэнд "-Номыг галзуу нохойны амнаас ч хамаагүй булаан авч сурдаг юм!" гэж сургаж байсан нь тэр үед санаанд орж байсан шүү.

Скалли бол олон ч нээлт хийсэн, нөлөөтэй том эрдэмтэн. Хүн эрдмийн ажил хийх нэг хэрэг. Гэтэл үүнийхээ хажуугаар менежмент сайн хийнэ гэдэг нь хүн болгонд байдаг авьяас биш. Скалли бол мундаг эрдэмтэн хэрнээ бас мундаг менежер хүн. Бараг 100 гаруй эрдэмтэд, PhD. оюутнууд түүний шууд удирдлага дор ажилладаг. Гэтэл надтай урьд нь уулзахдаа юу ярьж байсан, дараа уулзахдаа түүнийгээ л үргэлжлүүлээд ярьж чаддаг хүн. Гайхалтай чадвартай. Бид энэ төслийг Америкийн Батлан Хамгаалахын ахисан түвшиний Эрдэм шинжилгээний Агентлаг DARPA-аас авсан юм. Энэ бол зөвхөн квант физик төдийгүй биологитой холбоотой төсөл. Боомын халдвартай нянг аль болох хурдан хугацаанд танин мэдэх зорилготой. Энэ түүхийг ярилцлагын эхэнд дурдсан болно. Г.Г АНУ-д 9 сарын 11 ны террорист халдлагын дараа, биологийн халдлага болсон юм. Үүнээс болоод DARPA энэ төслийг хэрэгжүүлэхээр шийдсэн гэдэг.

Скаутын хөдөлгөөн үүссэн улс орон болгон Хүүхэд залуучуудын зуслан цугларалт буюу Жемборийг зохион байгуулдаг билээ. Энэхүү уламжлалын хүрээнд Монголын үндэсний тавдугаар Жемборийг "Сайн үйлсийн төлөө Нэгдэцгээе, Оролцоцгооё" уриатайгаар"  энэ оны долоодугаар сарын 2-8-ны хооронд Төв аймгийн Батсүмбэр сумын нутаг дахь Эко Скаут зусланд зохион байгуулах аж.

2001 онд Америкт биологийн алан хядах халдлага гарав. Шуудангаар илгээсэн боомын нянтай хэд хэдэн дугтуйг хүлээн авсан хүмүүс халдвар авсан байна. Ийм дугтуйг хүлээн авсан 22 хүнээс 5 нь нас баржээ. Квант физикийн нэрт эрдэмтэн судлаач, профессор Марлан Скаллигийн хүү нь онгоцны нисгэгч аж. Нэг удаагийн нислэгийн өмнөхөн онгоцноос нь дугтуйтай үл мэдэгдэх нунтаг олдсоноор зорчигчид нь айн сандралдав. Биологийн ээлжит халдлага байж магадгүй хэмээн айн болгоомжилсон хэрэг.

Харамсалтай нь уг нунтгийг боомын халдварт нян мөн эсэхийг шуурхай мэдэх ямар ч боломжгүй бөгөөд заавал лабораторид аваачиж шинжилгээ хийдэг ёстой. Энэ хэрээр ихээхэн цаг хугацаа алддаг аж.

math:
There are many number systems. The base of the system determines the place value of each digit. The number system where place values are powers of 12 is called the duodecimal system. The digits used in this system are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T and E.

In a duodecimal place system, ten can be written as ᘔ, eleven can be written as Ɛ.
using "dek", "el" and "doh" as names for ten, eleven and twelve.

The ancient Babylonians used a number system with base 60 (sexagesimal).

In mathematics, two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities.
Mathematician Mark Barr proposed using the first letter in the name of Greek sculptor Phidias, phi, to symbolize the golden ratio. Usually, the lowercase form (φ) is used. Sometimes, the uppercase form (Φ) is used for the reciprocal of the golden ratio, 1/φ.

congruence
12 is congruent to 2 (modulo 5) since 12−2=2·5

convergence
An integral calculated over an interval of infinite width, called an improper integral, describes a region that is unbounded in at least one direction. If such an integral converges, the unbounded region it describes has finite area. A sequence of numbers converges to a particular number when the difference between successive terms becomes arbitrarily small. The sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc., converges to 1.

∞: lemniscate, a.k.a. infinity symbol.
a figure-eight shaped curve whose equation in polar coordinates is ρ2=a2 cos 2θ or ρ2=a2 sin 2θ.

Calculus classes, along with the accompanying physics-with-calculus classes, were what transformed my concept of math from a game you play with symbols into a powerful way to describe the way the world works.
There are definitely a lot of students who enjoy a calculus course for that experience. That seems to be a form of enjoyment that especially comes to students who have had time to learn about other topics on the way to learning calculus. Russian mathematical instruction tries harder than instruction in the United States to bring in examples from physical science at all ages, so that the mathematics that explains physics is taught to students who have a decent background in physics.

FMCW (frequency-modulated continuous wave) radar

In Doppler mode, the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) puts out a continuous tone at a fixed frequency.  The reflected signal is a frequency shifted version and speed can be determined.

Wireless transmission of energy can be achieved using several methods, such as  Inductive coupling, Electrodynamic induction and Resonant inductive coupling, far field electromagnetic radiation, laser and microwaves. 

Resonant inductive coupling is near field wireless transmission of electrical energy between two coils that are tuned to resonate at the same frequency. When properly designed, high efficiencies can be achieved.

Wireless power has a long history that includes the work of Ampere, Faraday, Hertz, Tesla, and other contributors in electromagnetic research.

Wireless technology to transmit power to mobile chargers is already on the market, and we can expect a grow in this technology i the near future.

Van de Graaff generator

So few people take high school or college physics classes, and so few of those who do attend have a long enough attention span to remember for more than a few days what they saw there...

Assuming that the power supply can deliver the current that's demanded, yes, current increases as voltage increases. Is it easier to get a damaging amount of current with a high voltage? Sure thing. Regardless, it's the current that causes damage.

Yes, if the belt were turned off, the charge would be, for all intents and purposes, static. If you wanted to increase the current, you would need to increase the number of charges per second being delivered to the dome. Increasing the speed of the motor would do this. So would widening the belt. Picking belt/pulley materials that are further apart on the triboelectric series would as well.

The ability to produce a spark is dependent on the voltage, not the current. In dry air, it's about 3,000,000 Volts per meter. The 'brightness' of the spark is what depends on the current.

Electrical conductivity of skin varies greatly, depending on a lot of factors. So, it can be quite high. It can also be surprisingly low. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that the presenter is a good enough conductor that his hair stands up and also immediately goes down once he touches the ground. If his body really did have infinite resistance, he wouldn't be able to collect a charge (his hair wouldn't stand up) and, if he had a charge, he would retain it upon touching the ground (his hair would remain standing upon touching the ground). Just by watching his hair, you can see that some current is flowing. The maximum steady state current that flows through him is limited by the physical construction of the Van de Graaff itself.

Volts never kill. It's just a measurement of the potential difference between two points.

Voltage plays a role in determining the current, but it's the current that flows through you and the current that kills you.

For the same reason why going to an all you can eat buffet doesn't mean that you have to eat -all- the food at the buffet. It's an upper limit. A 1000 A battery -can- supply 1000 A. It doesn't -have to- supply 1000 A. If the load demands 10 A, it gets 10 A. If it demands .01 A, it gets .01 A. If it demands 2000 A, then it's out of luck. Your body has a resistance on the order of 100,000 Ohms. That means it demands .00012 A from the 12 V battery, which is not anywhere close to being dangerous.

Even if you are perfectly insulated from the ground, there's still the problem of initially being at a different voltage than the power line. There will be a transient current as you are brought up to the line's voltage and that's easily enough to kill you.

Electric current is the number of charges passing a fixed point in second and voltage is a measurement of electric potential. To make an analogy with a waterfall, current is the amount of water going over the falls and voltage is the height of the falls. Amps is one unit used to measure current, just like meters is one unit used to measure distance.

Survivalism is a movement of individuals or groups (called survivalists or preppers) who are actively preparing for emergencies, including possible disruptions in social or political order, on scales from local to international. Survivalists often acquire emergency medical and self-defense training, stockpile food and water, prepare to become self-sufficient, and build structures (e.g., a survival retreat or an underground shelter) that may help them survive a catastrophe.

Tare weight /ˈtɛər/, sometimes called unladen weight, is the weight of an empty vehicle or container. By subtracting it from the gross weight (laden weight), the weight of the goods carried (the net weight) may be determined. This can be useful in computing the cost of the goods carried for purposes of taxation (sometimes called a tariff) or for tolls related to barge, rail, road, or other traffic, especially where the toll will vary with the value of the goods carried (e.g., tolls on the Erie Canal). Tare weight is often published upon the sides of railway cars and transport vehicles to facilitate the computation of the load carried. Tare weight is also used in body composition assessment when doing underwater weighing.
The word tare originates from the Middle French word tare "wastage in goods, deficiency, imperfection" (15c.), from Italian tara, from Arabic طرح ṭarḥ, lit. "thing deducted or rejected," from taraha "to reject".
Tare weight is accounted for in kitchen, analytical (scientific) weighing scales and other scales which include a button that resets the zero of the scale display when an empty container is placed on the weighing platform, in order to subsequently display only the weight of the contents of the container.
Gross weight (the total weight) = net weight (the weight of the goods) + tare weight (the weight of the empty container).

Peeling ginger with a spoon: Using the edge of the spoon with the convex of the bowl facing towards you, scrape away the ginger's papery skin using firm, downward strokes. You can anchor the root on a cutting board or hold it in your other hand, either will work. Scrape away as much as needed from the larger root (the rest of the root will give you a nice 'handle' to steady the process) or the whole piece if that's what's needed. The spoon will make it easier to work your way over and around all the little nubs. With a spoon, pretty much just the skin will be removed.

Way before Dropbox and Google Drive, there was an infra-red transceiver on old mobile phones which could send small amounts of data, such as your contact information, from one phone to another. Today's smartphone takes the next step with high speed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which can easily send gigabytes of data from one phone to another quickly, without taking a chunk out of your data plan allowance.

Mind over Matter: Secrets of human aura revealed by Russian scientists:
A Russian scientist is trying to convince people they can change the world simply by using their own energy. He claims that thinking in a certain way can have a positive or negative effect on the surrounding environment. "We are developing the idea that our consciousness is part of the material world and that with our consciousness we can directly influence our world," said Dr. Konstantin Korotkov, a professor of physics at St. Petersburg State Technical University. To bridge our understanding of the unseen world of energy, scientific experiments are being carried out using a technique called bioelectrophotography. The assumption is that we are constantly emitting energy. Bioelectrophotography aims to capture these energy fields seen as a light around the body -- or what some people would call your aura.

WCC: world chess championship

Carlsen's often opaque playing style, with its emphasis on endgames and physical toughness so as to exploit mistakes after a long and tiring session, is one reason he has detractors. It reflects the change from four-hour sessions followed by an overnight adjournment to six or seven hours without a break and with speeded up play for the later moves.

Magnus Carlsen has a grasp on the game 'that would usually take players 20 to 30 years'.

Magnus Carlsen, the new world chess champion, makes it sound so simple. But the possibilities in chess are almost infinite, and quite how he routinely - and apparently so effortlessly - identifies the best moves, fills the chess world with awe.

There is talk of him storming through the 2900 Elo rating barrier: in chess that would be a psychological breakthrough roughly equivalent to when Roger Bannister broke the 4-minute mile.

Carlsen is the complete chess player. He is brilliant at strategy as well as tactics: he has mastery of the opening, the middle game, the endgame. 

His memory is prodigious, almost photographic. He is said to hold 10,000 games in his head. He can play 10 games blindfold (without looking at the boards).

He's also physically fit - an essential ingredient to his success. Concentrating for hours at the board is - non-chess players may be surprised to hear - physically draining.

Carlsen enjoys long games, grinding out victory after victory as he slowly, inevitably, wears down his opponents.

That discipline and competitiveness is another vital component in his emotional make-up.

American world champion Bobby Fischer said he enjoyed the moment when he could sense the ego of his opponent crumble.

And, clearly, Carlsen also relishes the psychological warfare. 

Magnus Carlsen is Mozart in the world of chess. He played with 10 opponents at the same time, not looking at the chess boards and won. He kept tracking 320 chess pieces simultaneously. It seems out of this world to play with ten guy and win just with the power of thought.

Numerous experiments over the past few years have shown that the best way to build new neural pathways is to try and recall it afresh, helping subjects remember more than twice as much, over the long term, than just passively reading the material; self-testing also turns out to be more effective than creative techniques like drawing diagrams and mind maps.

Although you can find other apps designed for rote learning and drilling in this way, Memrise makes use of another trick. Detre had found that the most effective time to reactivate a memory is when you feel that it is half-remembered, half-forgotten – when you feel it’s on the “tip of your tongue” but you can't quite reach it. So the Memrise team have designed an algorithm that predicts the arrival of that agonising state, and then springs a test on you. Since the app constantly tracks your progress, over time it becomes more accurate at predicting your learning curve, helping you surf the waves of your memory to more efficient learning.

Make a Commitment to Achieve Every Single Day
Although waking up one morning with a proactive and positive outlook is to be encouraged, it means little if you are unable to commit to this every single day. Recommitting to your routine and the pursuit of your goals is crucial to achieving success; otherwise, the pressures of everyday life can divert your focus. While this requires tremendous drive and strength of character, it will ultimately empower you to be successful over a prolonged period of time.

There's a lot of truth in your post, most “prodigies” of any field DO work hard to get where they are.

However, we are talking specifics. Specific subject, sport, ability.

I see true genius, prodigy, and intelligence not in what one can master… but in how quickly.

Your post is uplifting and gives hope for us “non-prodigy” people. However, there’s no going around the fact that, for example, my good friend can memorise 50+ foreign words in the time it takes me to memorise 10. Or read three books in the time I read one, and with better recollection than mine (on ANY subject we ever had together).

It is true, anyone can master a specific ground with perseverance. However, the sheer speed is what separates “anyone” from genius. And while we are still determined to do “A” the genius is already on “E, F, G” … that to me is the disheartening part.

(см.):
Сегодня мы знаем, что молекула ДНК является носителем кода, который управляет химизмом всего живого (см. Центральная догма молекулярной биологии), а двойная спираль молекулы ДНК стала одним из самых известных научных символов. Открытие ДНК, как и практически все великие открытия, не было результатом работы одинокого гения, а увенчало собой длинную цепь экспериментальных работ.
Такой «возможный механизм копирования» определен структурой ДНК. Когда клетка приступает к делению и необходима дополнительная ДНК для дочерних клеток, ферменты (см. Катализаторы и ферменты) начинают «расстегивать» лестницу ДНК, как застежку-«молнию», обнажая индивидуальные основания. Другие ферменты присоединяют соответствующие основания, находящиеся в окружающей жидкой среде, к парным «обнажившимся» основаниям — А к Т, Г к Ц и т. д. В результате на каждой из двух разошедшихся цепей ДНК достраивается соответствующая ей цепь из компонентов окружающей среды, и исходная молекула дает начало двум двойным спиралям.

During the height of the Cold War the Soviet Union built up a network of "Naukograd" or "Science Cities". These were state-created clusters of scientists working on technologies that could help it compete with the West, especially in the field of nuclear weapons and space exploration. Those days are of course long gone, but today Russia -- though now freed from the days of the old USSR -- now faces a new race: how to revive its economy, compete globally in the next industrial revolution of science and technology and wean itself off its reliance on oil and gas.

The Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) is a private graduate research university in Skolkovo, Russia, a suburb of Moscow. Established in October 2011 in collaboration with MIT, Skoltech educates global leaders in innovation, advances scientific knowledge and fosters new technologies to address critical issues facing Russian and the world. Applying international research and educational models, the university integrates the best Russian scientific traditions with twenty-first century entrepreneurship and innovation.

Declining Virility of Men and the Importance of Testosterone
Testosterone is the fuel that will power you along the road to manhood. It’s what makes men strong, daring, and aggressive.
Free Testosterone. This is testosterone in its purest form. It’s the crack of testosterone, if you will. The reason it’s called “free” is because there aren’t any proteins attached to it. Unbound to other molecules, free T can enter cells and activate receptors in order to work its virile magic on your body and mind.

A man's claim to virtue is weak if he doesn’t have the virile fortitude and strength to back it up when challenged. The cloak of virtue hangs very awkwardly on a man without fire and fight; it droops and sags when draped across a structure that lacks strength and firmness. We all know amiable men who are sickly thin or grossly overweight, who look like they’d burst into tears if a bully broke their walking stick and would get winded mounting a flight of stairs.

Foster a DIY mentality

You don't have time to do all of the homework, and kind of repeat them, but pick some of the key ones and see if you can do it again. Like practice it, and maybe do it in your mind. Can you step through all the steps? If you can play it almost like a song in your mind, you've really got it. You've got it down as a chunk, and that can help build your knowledge of the material. Now, probably the most valuable technique when you're trying to really understand something difficult is simple recall.

Read in sentences at once(at a time), resist the urge to reread or underline, instead, look away and recall the text, that's very powerful in building your understanding of the material in a way that other techniques, including mind mapping and re-reading are not nearly as good as recall. (Barbara Oakley | Learning How to Learn | Talks at Google)

A Rube Goldberg machine is a contraption, invention, device or apparatus that is deliberately over-engineered or overdone to perform a very simple task in a very complicated fashion, usually including a chain reaction. The expression is named after American cartoonist and inventor Rube Goldberg (1883–1970).

The cooking method that best retains nutrients is one that cooks quickly, heats food for the shortest amount of time, and uses as little liquid as possible. Microwaving meets those criteria. Using the microwave with a small amount of water essentially steams food from the inside out. That keeps more vitamins and minerals than almost any other cooking method.

Using too much water can leach vitamins and minerals out of food.
The rumor: Zapping food in a microwave leaches out key nutrients.
The verdict: If you do it right, cooking food in the microwave is one of the best ways to retain your food's vitamins and minerals.

three-prong plug
Why do electrical plugs have a hole in each prong?
(Within the outlet, there are 2 plates with dull indentations that press into the holes and help hold in the cord, so it doesn't fall out as easily. 
Also, some special outlets allow you to lock the cord into the socket, so it can't be removed, by putting rods through the holes.
If you were to take apart an outlet and look at the contact wipers that the prongs slide into, you would find that they have have bumps on them. These bumps fit into the holes so that the outlet can grip the plug's prongs more firmly. This detenting prevents the plug from slipping out of the socket due to the weight of the plug and cord. It also improves the contact between the plug and the outlet.
Electrical devices can be "factory-sealed" or "locked-out" by the manufacturer or owner using a plastic tie or a small padlock that runs through one or both of the prong holes. Construction projects or industrial safety requirements may require this type of sealing. For example, a manufacturer might apply a plastic band through the hole and attach it to a tag that says, "You must do blah blah blah before plugging in this device." The user cannot plug in the device without removing the tag, so the user is sure to see the instructions.)

My videos are not only meant to help induce ASMR or tingles, but also help provide a relaxing, calming and soothing experience for the viewer while helping to provide stress relief (especially for those suffering from depression, anxiety and even PTSD), help people sleep and even serve as a study aid.

「自分には才能がないから天職なんか見つけられない」とネガティブに考える人もいるかもしれないが，これも間違いである。最も注目すべき点は，その鍵となるのは「天から授かった才能や適正」なんかではなくて，「その職についていて楽しくて楽しくてしょうがないこと」だという点だ。

マラソンのランナーは，毎日のように20キロも30キロも走る。私にとっては，たとえ5キロのランニングでも，精神的にも肉体的にも信じがたいような苦痛だが，彼らにとってはそれは本当の意味での「苦痛」ではないのだ。確かに，肉体的には過酷なことをしているし，精神的にも肉体的にも常に自分自身をレースに備えた状態に保つのは簡単な話ではない。しかし，マラソンを走り続ける人たちに共通して言えることは，彼ら自身が，そんな努力を自ら喜んでやっている点だ。

“８０２０”は“ハチ・マル・二イ・マル”と読み、 「８０２０運動」とは“８０歳になっても２０本以上自分の歯を保とう”という運動です。平成元年、厚生省（現・厚生労働省）と 日本歯科医師会が提唱し、 自治体、各種団体、企業、そして広く国民に呼びかけてきました。

なぜ、あえて８０２０という数字を掲げたのか、 その理由は…… 智歯（親知らず）を除く２８本 の歯のうち、 少なくとも２０本以上自分の歯があれば、 ほとんどの食物を噛みくだくことができ、 おいしく食べられるからです。 つまり、 “高齢になっても２０本以上自分の歯を保ちましょう” というのが、その主旨です。

この運動を、国民運動としてさらに発展させていくために、歯科に関係のある各種団体、企業の協力のもと平成１２年１２月１日、厚生大臣（現厚生労働大臣）の許可を得て設立されたのが「（財）８０２０推進財団」。 その事業活動は、８０２０運動の推進はもとより、 口腔と全身との関係に関する情報の 収集・提供・調査研究などを主な柱としています。
