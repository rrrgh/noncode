•i stands for ignore case (optional in your case). 
•R stands for recursive. 
•l stands for "show the file name, not the result itself".
•/ stands for starting at the root of your machine.

grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
•-r or -R is recursive, 
•-n is line number, and 
•-w stands match the whole word. 
•-l (lower-case L) can be added to just give the file name of matching files.
•Along with these, --exclude or --include parameter could be used for efficient searching. Something like below:
grep --include=\*.{c,h} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"

This will only search through the files which have .c or .h extensions. Similarly a sample use of --exclude:
grep --exclude=*.o -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"

Above will exclude searching all the files ending with .o extension. Just like exclude file it's possible to exclude/include directories through --exclude-dir and --include-dir parameter; for example, the following shows how to integrate --exclude-dir:
grep --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,*.dst} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"

It depends on what you are trying to test. If you are interested in latency, use time/iteration and if you are interested in throughput use iterations/time.

Java Persistence query language (JPQL) is used to define searches against persistent entities independent of the mechanism used to store those entities. As such, JPQL is "portable", and not constrained to any particular data store. The Java Persistence query language is an extension of the Enterprise JavaBeans query language, EJB QL, adding operations such as bulk deletes and updates, join operations, aggregates, projections, and subqueries. Furthermore, JPQL queries can be declared statically in metadata, or can be dynamically built in code.

Unchecked exceptions:
represent defects in the program (bugs) - often invalid arguments passed to a non-private method. To quote from The Java Programming Language, by Gosling, Arnold, and Holmes: "Unchecked runtime exceptions represent conditions that, generally speaking, reflect errors in your program's logic and cannot be reasonably recovered from at run time."
are subclasses of RuntimeException, and are usually implemented using IllegalArgumentException, NullPointerException, or IllegalStateException
a method is not obliged to establish a policy for the unchecked exceptions thrown by its implementation (and they almost always do not do so)
Checked exceptions:
represent invalid conditions in areas outside the immediate control of the program (invalid user input, database problems, network outages, absent files)
are subclasses of Exception
a method is obliged to establish a policy for all checked exceptions thrown by its implementation (either pass the checked exception further up the stack, or handle it somehow)
It's somewhat confusing, but note as well that RuntimeException (unchecked) is itself a subclass of Exception (checked).

Use reflection:

method.invoke(obj, (Object)String.valueOf(char_array)); // (Object)

Why there is no local static variable in Java?
The Java language spec doesn't seem to defend the omission of variables that correspond to C static variables.

Hiding state in class methods has a few drawbacks when seen from a Java perspective. Generally the existence of a function-level static variable isn't the sort of implementation detail that you'd want to expose outside of that function.

But the method's state is actually part of the class's state, and method-level static variables would have to be serialized / deserialized any time the object is persisted. This might not sound common, coming from a C background, so I'll note a few common examples.

Application server clusters can pass user session objects between nodes in order to provide fault tolerance.
JAXB could be used to marshall an object into an XML document
JPA can be used to persist object state to a database
If the variable's value is worth saving when the object is persisted, then there's a good chance that code outside of that class will need to reference that value. And suddenly that means defining access levels -- is a static variable in a public method automatically public? Or would a programmer have to declare it so?

We also have to think about extensibility. Would derived classes be required to implement the same static variable? Or would there be a reference to the variable from the function in the base class?

It's more likely that the C method that would use a static local variable would be a good candidate for a class in Java. It has state and hopefully exists for a single purpose. There's little drawback to encapsulating the functionality into an object, and it makes for a cleaner separation between transient values (such as local variables) and more long-term state.

java @Override
The @Override annotation was added in JDK 1.5. It functions more or less as a new method modifier. Its presence indicates to the compiler that the annotated method must override an existing supertype method, either from an interface, or an abstract base class. 
(When it was first introduced in JDK 1.5, @Override was only applicable to methods defined in a superclass, and not in a supertype. That is, it originally applied to overriding methods in a base class, but not to implementing methods defined in an interface. This was changed in JDK 7, and now @Override can be applied to both.) 

The most common use case for @Override is with Object methods: 
@Override public String toString(){...}
@Override public boolean equals(Object){...}
@Override public int hashCode(){...}

The main reason @Override was created was to deal with simple (but nasty) typographical errors. For example, a method mistakenly declared as public int hashcode(){...}
is in fact not an override - the method name has all lower case letters, so it doesn't exactly match the name of the hashCode() method. It will however compile perfectly well. Such an error is easy to make, and difficult to catch, which is a dangerous combination. Using the @Override annotation prevents you from making such errors. 
You should be in the habit of using @Override whenever you override a superclass method, or implement an interface method. 

Any method which is not private, static, or final can be overridden. Allowing a method to be overridden should always be done intentionally, not by accident. Overridable methods, and any methods which call them, represent unusual places in your code, to which special attention must be paid. This is because subclassing violates encapsulation, in the sense that it's possible for a subclass to break its superclass's contract. See Effective Java for more information. 
If you don't intend a method to be overridden, then you should declare it as private, static, or final. 
When you do override a method, you should use the @Override annotation. This allows the compiler to verify that the method is indeed a valid override of an existing method. For example, your implementations of toString, equals, and hashCode should always use @Override in the method header.
